title: Creating a Jekyll Blog
---
#### Purpose
Today I went about creating a blog for the first time. I've never had any sort of blog in the past. I will be creating it from scratch, and hopefully will find some cool tricks along the way.

One of the purposes of this is to learn [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as it's one of the options for [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). This page, will server as a place that I can share interesting technical tips or tricks that I discover while working on various projects.

In addition to that, I will post tricks I find over the course of developing this site which I hope will help future users of Jekyll get started.

At this point, I have a basic working Jekyll blog. There is no pagination, no commenting, but the basics are there. Some of the things that I will be working towards implementing are:

* Categories for posts
* Commenting (probably through disqus, althouth this is lower priority)


The code for this blog is available at [kwbock/kwbock.github.com](http://github.com/kwbock/kwbock.github.com)
