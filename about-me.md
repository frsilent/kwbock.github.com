I'm a software developer by trade, and for the majority of my career that has been focused on web applications although I have worked in Java, C++, Objective-C and other compiled languages.

Currently my focus has mainly been around Django/Python and Ruby on Rails. I'm a Django developer at my day job, and a Ruby on Rails developer in my freetime.
